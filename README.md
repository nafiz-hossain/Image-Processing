# Median Filtering using Python and OpenCV

This repository contains Python code for performing median filtering on an image using OpenCV library. Median filtering is a non-linear image processing technique used to remove noise from images. 

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, you need to have the following software installed on your system:
* Python 3
* OpenCV library
* Numpy library
* Statistics library

## Installation

To install the required libraries, run the following command in your terminal:
`pip install opencv-python numpy statistics`


## Usage

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the directory where the repository is cloned
3. Run the following command:

`python median_filtering.py`


The filtered image will be saved as `filtered.png` in the same directory.
